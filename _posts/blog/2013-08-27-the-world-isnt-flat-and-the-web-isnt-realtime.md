People say "we live in the era of realtime web". I cannot agree perfectly. Here I will explain my concern. We are not "realtime" because we live in different time zones. I'm in Tokyo. It's 4pm now. At the same time, it's night time for Europeans and Americans. My Twitter timeline is slow because they may be asleep.


## A Kind Of Digital Divide ##

The line of longitude lies between the Western world and Japan. We live in different time zones. I live in the "UTC+9" world. [^utc] It's 4pm in Tokyo (UTC+9, Japanese Standard Time), 8am in London (UTC+1, British Summer Time), 3am in New York (UTC-4, Eastern Daylight Time) and midnight in San Francisco (UTC-7, Pacific Daylight Time).

Critically, the mantra of "realtime web" is Western-centric. I'm here in Tokyo, Japan, the Far East from the Western world. I live in the 9-hours-ahead world. (It's a joke. Don't take me seriously. )

This "time divide" is a kind of digital divide. Eastern people have a (small) disadvantage on realtime information accessibility. Even though it's not a big problem, it is surely affecting us. For example, my timeline is slow in the afternoon.


## Time Divide Is A Physical Problem ##

Can we solve "time divide" problems? No, at least in the near future. There are physical conditions and we cannot change them. There is a 15,000km distance physically. People sleep at night physically. These conditions are firm enough.

A large part of my life has migrated to the Infosphere. Still I'm not free from physical bodies. Inforgs are not free from physical constraints. Inforgs, informational organisms, are neither bots nor software agents. Inforgs cannot live without food and sleep because they are organisms.

Someday in the future, technology will enable us to completely migrate to the Infosphere. This kind of reality is illustrated in the famous cyberpunk animation film Ghost in the Shell [^Ghost], but the migration is still transitional. The complete migration to the Infosphere can be seen in the cyberpunk animation film Zegapain [^Zegapain].

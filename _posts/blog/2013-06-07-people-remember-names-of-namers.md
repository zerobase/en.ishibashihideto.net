## Yellow Fade Technique ##

On Facebook, you will see the Yellow Fade Technique by clicking the Notification Jewel, the globe icon on the top of the screen. Try clicking a notification such as "{Someone} likes your comment" and you will see the transition effect like this video: [Yellow Fade Technique on Facebook].

See? The item being notified is highlighted for a moment, with a yellow background. It disappears in seconds. This transition effect attracts users' attention. This method was named "Yellow Fade Technique" in 2004 by 37signals. Although I am not certain how popular this name is, this method has been used by many designers for years. The concept and method of the Yellow Fade Technique is widely spread.


## Inventor vs Namer ##

Here is a list of names and namers:

- [Yellow Fade Technique by 37signals]
- [Ajax by Jesse James Garret at Adaptive Path]
- [Lean Startup by Eric Ries]

I remember these names with these namers, not inventors of these methods. I don't know the names of inventors of these methods. I believe this tendency is not typical only to me. People tend to remember names of namers, without the names of inventors.

Name is power. Namer has power. Copywriting skills are very important for people whose names want to be remembered by people.


## A Lesson Learned ##

I will be careful about naming new concepts. Copywriting skills are necessary.

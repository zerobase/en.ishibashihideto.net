I attended a [Senior Experience Workshop at GLOCOM, Tokyo on Wednesday, May 8, 2013]. GLOCOM is the [Center for Global Communications, International University of Japan]. There were 16 participants in their twenties to fifties.

The participants played the roles of senior people wearing some attachments:

- Gibs to lock the knees,
- A blurring glass that simulates cataracts,
- Finger coats that cover the first and second joints to restrict finger movements, and
- A heavy jacket.

With these obstacles, we cannot move as we do everyday. It is hard to sit on a chair because our knees are locked.

After the preparation, the instructor, [Shinya Oguro], left us "alone" for 20 minutes after telling us to "try doing nothing". This is the everyday life of senior people who live alone. Some people felt fear, anxiety or depression.

I understand the importance of health. The less physical capability, the less motivation. What I want to do is constrained by what I can do physically. These are the implications of [Affordance Theory] by J. J. Gibson.

From the liberal point of view, health and wellness can be a political goal. On the other hand, from the libertarian point of view, it is not the administration's business. I have not decided my political stance on this topic yet.

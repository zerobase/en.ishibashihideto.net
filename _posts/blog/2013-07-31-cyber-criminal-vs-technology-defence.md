I've received a deceitful message via Facebook. It's far more stereotyped. So funny:

> I am ***, Attorney to the late Mr. R. Ishibashi, who worked with the Shell Development Company in Lome-Togo. On the 1st of June 2009, my client and his wife and their only daughter were involved in an automobile accident.
> 
> Please, I need your assistance in repatriating my late client's fund valued at USD 5.5 million.

I've blocked her. In the dialog box, there's no choice for reporting her as a 'possible deceiver' to Facebook. I want Facebook to verify her on behalf of me. It is not an unreasonable demand. It is feasible to automate a statistical analysis process to filter criminal signals and noise.

Today, everyone is targeted by cyber criminals with the software. They automate the process of deception to reach massive victims. This new type of criminal cannot be arrested by old-style investigations. Technologies can.

Security in cyberspace will be ensured by the software, or the architecture, not by human investigators without computers. Both criminals and investigators use computers to augment their power in cyberspace. Cyberspace is a battlefield where the software technologies turn out to be weapons.

Some conservative people might say that a society ruled by software is a nightmare. They could prefer 'self defense' rather than a 'police state'. They may have a point. But I think that such kind of 'anarchism' is subject to anomie (lack of social norms).

I prefer the social architecture with lower social costs. For that purpose, civic order by software is unavoidable.
